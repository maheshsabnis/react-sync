# Folder Structure
    - package.json
        - File with all dependency packages
    - src folder
        - Contains all source code file for following
            - Compoents
            - Services
            - Models
            - Utilities
    - public folder
        - The Production Files
            - index.html, the DOM that will be mounted in browser
# React.js Object Models
    - Component
        - Autonomous Object that contains
            - User Interface with Compiled JSX
            - State Properties to Bind Data with UI Elements
            - Methods, those are executed when events are raised on UI Elements
        - Component Types
            - The 'Class Component', a Traditional ES 6 approach for Creating React Component that is derived from Component<P,S> base class
                - This contains Lifecycle Methods for effectively managing the Component execution once it is Mounted on UI THread
                    - constructor()
                        - Contains State Properties declaration using the 'state' object with initial Values
                    - shouldComponentUpdate()    
                        - Check if the state is changed so that component can be updated 
                    - componentWillUpdate()
                        - If the shouldComponentUpdate() retuirns treue then new Vitrual DOM is created
                    render()
                        - Mount the UI on Browser UI Thread    
                    - componentDidCatch()
                        - Method to render a fallback view when the child compoennt crash    
                    - componentDidMount()
                        - Executed after the render() completes its execution and this contains resource-intensice code e.g. Ajax calls
                        - This may resule in component's properties update and agsin calls
                            - shouldComponentUpdate()
                            - componentWillUpdate()
                            - render()
            - The 'Functional Component', from React 16+ (Recommended)
                - A JavaScript Function that returns the DOM
                - No Lifecycle method explicitly available
                - No explicit declation of the 'state' object for declaring state properties                    
                - The React 16.8+ use 'React Hooks' for State, Lifecycle, Data Communication across components, State updates, etc.
                    - useState()
                        - Declare and Update State with fix type
                    - useEffect()
                        - Manage resource intensive operations and State updates
                    - useContext()
                        - Share data across components
                    - useReducer()
                        - State update with 'State Transition'
                        - From Initial to Final Value when the type of final value is not known
                    - useRef()
                        - Reference for DOM
                    - ... and many more
                - Hooks are JavaScript functions with predefined behavior taht is configured for React Functional components    

    - react
        - provides 'React' class
        - Following Types
            - Component<P,S>
                - The base class for all components
                - The 'P' is props
                - The 'S' is state
            - PureComponent
                - A Specially defined Component base class to Performance improvisation   
                    - does not innoke the shouldComponentUpdate() method              
    - react-dom
        - Provides 'ReactDOM' class  
            - Used to Mount the DOM from Component on UI Thread              
# Programming Concepts with React
    -  Creating Components
        - State and Props
            - useState()
            - useEfect() for ajax calls
            - useReducer() for state transition
            - Data Validations
        - Parent Child Components
            - Reusable Components  
                - using props for pass data from Parent to Child
                - emit and event from child to parent
            - using React.Context
                - data communicaiton across component
                - Events across components 
    - Error Handling with Components aka Error Boundary
        - Use the class component    
        - componentDidCatch()
    - Portals
    - Using Fragments
    - Routing
        - Lazy Loading with fallback
    - Code-Splitting and load code asynchronously on UI         
    - Working with Redux
    - Performing Unit Testing
